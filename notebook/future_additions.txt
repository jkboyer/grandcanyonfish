# Ideas for functions and data to add to grandcanyonfish package

plot theme

fish silouettes to use in plots

river mile to lat/long data and conversion function

function to find species errors based on TL/FL/weight

function to predict species based on TL/FL ratio

ASCII native fish art

additional big boy tables

tables of total/fork/weight in 1 mm increments for common species (to provide plotable lines)
(maybe even ribbons to show maximum plausible?)

Basemap with plotting by river mile enabled (use ggplot to plot map)

download GCMRC gauge data (like dataRetrieval)
